### PURPOSE:
To enable a stationary bike to control computer games so that a biker can race in a game while exercising.

### HOW IT WORKS:
The Arduino Leonardo is plugged into a computer where it emulates a keyboard and constantly measures the bike's speed (RPM) and checks that state of the steering.  In the game, the vehicleâ€™s speed and steering are varied by rapidly modulating the arrow key presses sent to the computer by the Leonardo.
For example: if the bike is above the goal RPM (defined as a constant in the code) then it will effectively press the up arrow continously; and at 50% of the goal speed the up arrow will be pressed 50% of the time on average by the Leonardo.

### RESULTS:
* The system is able to control any racing computer game that can be controlled by arrow keys.
* The faster the biker pedals, the faster the race car will go.
* The sharper the biker turns, the sharper the rac car will turn.
* Read the [project poster](https://github.com/danielengbert/bike-game/blob/master/project_poster.pdf) and watch the [video demo](https://youtu.be/r04d039daLk).

### REQUIREMENTS:
* Arduino Leonardo
* custom printed circuit board (see EAGLE CAD files in the PCB folder)
  * and a few resistors and cables
* hall effect sensor
* neodymium magnet
* 1 IR emmiter and 2 IR receivers (serve as a photointerrupter for the steering)
* lazy susan (for the bike's front tire)
* bike and stationary bike stand

### NOTE:
The next phase of this project would be to add capacitive touch sensor to the bike's handlebar for more game control (like activating turbo) and also to add a fan that blows air on the biker at a strength relative to their bike speed.  Preliminary development of this portion of the project was started and built into the PCB.
