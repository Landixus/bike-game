bike-game

My 2015 High School Capstone Project with mentorship from Christopher Rogers

PURPOSE:

To enable a stationary bike to control computer games so that a biker can race in a game while exercising.

REQUIREMENTS:

* Arduino Leonardo
* custom printed circuit board (see EAGLE CAD files in the PCB folder)
  * and a few resistors and cables
* hall effect sensor
* neodymium magnet
* 1 IR emmiter and 2 IR receivers



RESULTS:

* The system is able to control any racing computer game that can be controlled by arrow keys.
* The faster the biker pedals, the faster the race car will go
* The sharper the biker turns, the sharper the rac car will turn


NOTE:

The next phase of this project was intended to be adding capacitive touch sensor to the bike's handlebar for more game control (like activating turbo) and also to add a fan that blows air on the biker at a strength relative to their bike speed.  Preliminary development of this portion of the project was started but not fully completed.
